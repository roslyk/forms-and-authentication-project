## About Laravel

A small forms and authentication project where it is possible to register, log in and log out. An important concept in this project is middleware. Middleware is used to restrict access to certain routes. This means (among other things) that those logged in cannot see the register page and those that are authenticated/logged in cannot see the log in button.
